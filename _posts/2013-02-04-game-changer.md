From cleantechnica.com :


>According to a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between El Paso Electric Company and First Solar, electricity will be sold from First Solarâ€™s thin-film solar panels to El Paso Electric Company for 5.8 cents per kWh.
>The highly unusual thing about this is that the average residential retail cost of electricity in the United States is
>11.4 cents per kWh, which is twice as much as the price at which this power plant will be producing electricity !
