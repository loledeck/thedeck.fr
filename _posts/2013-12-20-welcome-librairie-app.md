title: Welcome Librairie App

Librairie is my new iOS app. You can find it here: 

[Librairie on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/librairie/id742022507?l=fr&ls=1&mt=8)

It’s an ebook reading app that scans your Dropbox account to find your epub files. They’re automatically classified and available for streaming or download from the app.

More coming soon …
