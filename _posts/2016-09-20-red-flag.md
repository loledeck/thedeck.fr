Flag is a startup sending you 20 prints of your pictures a month for *free*.

<br>
From [Flag's Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flag/flagfree-photo-prints-forever) :

>Flag's free printing and shipping are paid for with ads. We use the blank space on the back of each print, that's been wasted for the last 100 years, to deliver extra photos, captions and targeted advertising.

Speaking of wasted ad real estate, I'd like to remember those nice marketers that the back of my iMac is still available. Hurry up, won't last for ever !
