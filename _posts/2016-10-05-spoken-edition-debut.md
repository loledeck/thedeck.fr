[Appleinsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/03/spoken-editions-section-makes-official-debut-on-apples-itunes) :

>The section currently includes articles from over 40 sources, such as Reuters, Wired, IGN, Jezebel, Playboy, and the Huffington Post. People can also access the material from Apple's dedicated Podcasts app.

Audio only version of Playboy articles. Looks like a winner to me.
