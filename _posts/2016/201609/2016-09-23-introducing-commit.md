Commit DB is my new project, freshly released in the App Store.

<br>

It is a [modern MySQL client for iOS](http://commit.cubesoft.fr). Its goal is to let developpers and DBAs develop code, query and manage their databases from their iOS devices.

The app is optimized for the iPad pro with support for multitasking and keyboard shortcuts while still being useful on the iPhone for quick queries.

A detailed description of the feature set is available at the above link while the app can be downloaded on the App Store:
