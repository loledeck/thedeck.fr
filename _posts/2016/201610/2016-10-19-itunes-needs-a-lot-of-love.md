I'm an Apple Music user. And as such, I'm interrested in saying to iTunes that I *"like"* a song to get better recommandations in the future.

In the latest Sierra iTunes, I got used to click on the "..." icon because the heart that was present in El Capitan had disappeard. Or had it ?

As you can see in the screenshot above there's in fact still a tiny ♡ that you can click to like a song. Except that it is white on white and that you can't see it unless you click on it by accident.

But what is *really* weird is that clicking this ♡ does not actually select the *"like"* option in the menu for a song. So you can at the same time *"like"* and ♡ a song and they're not the same thing apparently.

Ok, who I am to say that you can only love a song in a single way ? But what this star means ?

Seriously Apple, when you are done fixing Siri, please take a look at the iTunes ratings system. It could use some love ...
