Big update for my ebooks reading app, [Librairie](http://librairie.cubesoft.fr).

<br>
<br>
Highlights features:

- Dark mode for the UI 
- Import your ebooks from other apps throught an action extension available in the iOS share sheet
- Read aloud your ebooks with speech-to-text
- San Francisco font available in the reader

Plus of course a lot of small fixes and tweaks.

Grab it while it's hot !
