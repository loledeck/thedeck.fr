Interresting concept from Microsoft, the new [Surface Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-studio/tech-specs).

It's squarely aimed at creative professionals, a demographic that has always been the bread and butter of Apple pro hardware. 

Seems a little light specswise compared to a Mac Pro (I mean, compared to what could be a Mac Pro today if it had been updated less than three years ago).

I hope it will succeed to shame Apple into caring more about its pro line.

However, it is clearly not for me. For one, I couldn't draw anything to save my life so I wouldn't use it for that purpose. But it seems to be a really clever use of touch for a desktop computer. 

The big drawback: the smudges it will create on the screen. I'm already mad at the rare finger traces on my non-touch iMac screen, it would *positively* drive me crazy !
