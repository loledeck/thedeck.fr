Brent Simmons, speaking about the [Surface Studio](http://inessential.com/2016/10/26/surface_studio_notes):
<br>
<br>

> Except — and this part shouldn’t be underestimated — many of these Mac developers are here because Macs are the computer for creative professionals and artists. That’s what attracted us to Macs in the first place.

> It’s more than a niche. It’s our identity as Mac developers: we write apps for people who make things. But what if the Surface Studio takes over as the computer for people who make things? And what if we could bring over some of our investment (such as learning Swift) with us?

> I never thought to even consider that as a possible future.

You don't find much more hardcore mac developper than Simmons. The fact he's even thinking about the faintest possibility of jumping ship shows two things

1. that Microsoft has desgined a very audacious and interresting product

2. that Apple has so much neglected its core audience of old that the cracks are starting to show
