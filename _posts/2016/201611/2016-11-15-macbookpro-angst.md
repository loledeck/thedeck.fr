John Gruber's conclusion in his new [MacBook Pros review](http://daringfireball.net/2016/11/new_touch_bar_equipped_macbook_pros):

<br>

> There’s much griping about these machines now, just like there was much griping about the original Air then, but these are exactly the MacBooks I want Apple to be making — ones that show that the company is putting very hard work into every aspect of them. I’d be more worried about Apple’s commitment to the Mac if they did the easy thing — easier both technically and in terms of initial critical response — and just stuck a retina display in a MacBook Air and called it a day. 

I don't think anybody is really worried about Apple's commitment to the Mac in general. All the angst is about the high-performance macs specifically.

In a time when we don't know if the Mac Pro is still of this world or not, the fear comes from people who ask themselves: "Can I use these laptops as my *only* computer ?". And whose response is a resounding NO for more and more pros.

Come on Apple, if you're working on a new Mac Pro in any way, shape or form just say it. What do you have to loose ? The current Mac Pro sales ? xD
