For those who have liked the [Lucky Knot Bridge](http://kottke.org/16/11/chinas-lucky-knot-bridge) posted by Kotke this morning I humbly present la passerelle *Simone de Beauvoir*.

This bridge is located in Paris and links the 13th district (on the left bank of the Seine river) with the 12th district (on the right bank). It was opened in 2006.

Paris is a beautifull city, more modern than what one might imagine.
