[Micheal J. Tsai](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/12/12/which-macs-are-people-using/) speaking of the mac models used by the users of its macOS apps:

<br>

> The numbers for the MacBook seem really low to me. The 2% (1.68% before rounding) includes both the MacBook One and the plastic MacBook that was discontinued in early 2012. The 12-inch MacBook never seemed attractive to me—overpriced and underpowered, not to mention the keyboard—but I would have expected to see more people using it. 
> <br> [...] <br>
> It’s frustrating that Apple sees the MacBook One as a worthwhile niche but doesn’t want to make a high-end MacBook Pro with a larger display, more RAM, a real keyboard and trackpad, etc.

Some niches seem more comfy than other in the new Mac ecosystem.
