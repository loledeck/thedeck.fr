Tim Cook in an internal memo reported by [Matthew Panzarino at TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/apples-tim-cook-assures-employees-that-it-is-committed-to-the-mac-and-that-great-desktops-are-coming/):

> The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people.

> The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world.

> Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.


Was it so hard, Apple ? 

Just acknowledging that your desktop line is still alive ? In my opinion, a lot of virtual ink would have been saved about the new MacBook Pros if they had said it earlier.

Now, this doesn't mean that we ("pro" users, whatever that means) are out of the woods the just yet. It may just be an iMac speed bump in the spring for all we know. But still, it feels much better than the void we've been living in for a long time.

On a related note, I thought a bit more about the end of the Apple branded monitors: I now think that it is sign that we will never see again (in the foreseable future at least) a screenless Apple desktop. It's one thing for Apple to send its customers to LG for a secondary display used with a laptop. It a completly different one to release a brand new machine that *cannot* be used without an add-on sold by another company.

The Mac Pro and the Mac Mini won't probably ever be updated again in their current form. Brace yourself for some kind of iMac Pro.
