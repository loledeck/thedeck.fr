The dialog goes away. iTunes still does not allow me to listen to music. I close and re-open iTunes. I log off and on a few times. I finally reboot my Mac. I discover that the artist I would love to listen to that morning is not available on iTunes Music. I select another artist. I hit play. Music does not come out from the built-in speakers. I plug in my old 2002 Harman Kardon SoundSticks. I plug the USB 3 to USB dongle first.

Open and close apps on both devices. I reboot them both. Pages for Mac tells me that there is a conflict between the versions in both devices, even though I have never edited the file on the Mac. I select the version on the iPad. My changes are lost.

>This seems too bad to be real, but I’ve had days recently that feel like this. I have an old Mac and sometimes think a new one would be more reliable, until I read about problems people are having with a brand new MacBook Pro and display. At least I don’t have kernel panics.

And at the same time, in a slightly parallel universe [Jason Snell reports at Sixcolors.com about the latest Apple quartely results](https://sixcolors.com/post/2017/01/apples-record-quarter-by-the-numbers/):

>Mac unit sales weren’t a record, but because of rising average sale prices (thanks, MacBook Pro!), **Mac revenue set a record**.

May be because people are buying new Macs hoping they'll be more reliable ?
