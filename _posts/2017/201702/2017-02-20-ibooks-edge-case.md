As the developper of an [iOS app to manage your ebooks library](http://librairie.cubesoft.fr), let me tell you that 700 ebooks is *far* from an edge case. A quick query in my stats showed me that the *average* number of ebooks per active user in Librairie is 1134. This makes total sense when you think about it: people using this kind of apps are serious about managing their whole books library and are voracious readers.

As most Apple apps, iBooks is designed for casual users. The ones who will buy a handfull of ebooks in the iBooks Store and don't even know what an ePub file is.
