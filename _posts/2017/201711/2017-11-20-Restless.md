Please, meet my new Apple Watch app: [Restless](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/restless-never-fall-asleep/id1048930054?l=fr&ls=1&mt=8).

The app helps you stay awake when you really need to: 
<br>
when you're driving late at night coming home after a party, when you want to pull an all-nighter to work for those midterms ... etc.

It works by using the Apple Watch haptic feedback to keep you focused. You'll receive a nudge regulary and when you're heart rate is seemingly shows that you're on the verge of falling asleep.

You can check it out on the App Store:
