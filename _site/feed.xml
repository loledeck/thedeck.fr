        <title>Red flag</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Flag is a startup sending you 20 prints of your pictures a month for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flag/flagfree-photo-prints-forever&quot;&gt;Flag’s Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Flag’s free printing and shipping are paid for with ads. We use the blank space on the back of each print, that’s been wasted for the last 100 years, to deliver extra photos, captions and targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of wasted ad real estate, I’d like to remember those nice marketers that the back of my iMac is still available. Hurry up, won’t last for ever !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thougths about iOS apps upgrade, a case study - Reeder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussions recently about the strategies app developers may use to upgrade their apps to a new version.
The argument is along the lines of the following points :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app devs rigthfully expect to be able to charge for the work they do to upgrade their apps in the long run&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An part of the apps users understand this and are willing to pay regularly for upgraded apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An other part of the apps users feels that they have already paid for an app and that should be enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I was strongly in the camp of the users feeling that we should pay for upgrades. After all, I am a professional developer (even though I’m not an app dev … yet) so I can very easily see the point of a dev who needs to bill customers for a living :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the case of one of my most beloved app came into light : Reeder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a longtime fan and daily user of Reeder. I had bought the iPhone version, the iPad version and then the OSX version. Enough to say that I was very pleased with all those versions and never regretted to shell out good euros for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came the Google Readerapocalypse …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silvio Rizzi, the Reeder developer, quickly released an update for the iPhone version allowing to sync your RSS feeds to feedbin, fever and (later I think) a few other services. But the iPad and OSX users were left in the cold, waiting for an update that would turn the stale pile of bits that those apps had become to a once again useful state.
Unfortunately, that update never came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he release Reeder 2, a new paid universal version of his iOS app.
The problem is not to upgrade to a new paid version. The problem is twofold :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app description does not make a good case of why I should upgrade. It states that Reeder 2 is a feedbin / fever / whatever … client and that you can share things with a lot of services. But that’s exactly what was the previous Reeder iPhone version. So why I’m upgrading exactly ??&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel kind of strong-armed here. Because the iPad version never got an update to allow to sync with anything else that Google Reader I kind of have to upgrade if I want to continue (or start again in this case) to use Reeder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the takeaway from this exactly ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a big difference between an application and a service. If I buy an application, I expect it to work for as long as the underlying OS allows it to run.
If I buy a service I expect it to function as long as I pay. The way M. Rizzi handled this upgrade makes me feel I’m paying for a service, not for an app. The fact that there’s no additional functionality described (except that the app is now running again on iPad) reinforce this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that it was not his fault if Google Reader passed away and the iPad version broke. But then why update the iPhone version back to a functioning state before the upgrade and not the iPad one ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I bought the new version anyway but I cannot help to feel that there’s a lot of goodwill lost in a case like this. And honestly, I’m not sure I’m going to buy the new OSX version when it will come out later this year. It was the version I used the least and I bought it mainly as a sign of support for the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that in this brave new iOS app store world, an app upgrade needs to articulate clearly what the value proposition is for the customer. If you need a recurring income to support your service, ask for a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So cute</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/10/4086458/father-hacks-donkey-kong-for-daughter-swaps-mario-pauline&quot;&gt;TheVerge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Mike Mika saw the disappointment on his daughter’s face when she realized Pauline wasn’t a playable character in Donkey Kong, he felt a call to action.
Thankfully Mika happens to be a competent developer, and after a few late-night hours spent hacking the NES version of Nintendo’s classic, he accomplished the role reversal his daughter had wished for. Mario was now under Donkey Kong’s control, and Pauline was tasked with rescuing the plumber in distress.
Following the successful endeavor, Mika shared some details of how he swapped the characters on a YouTube page demonstrating the hack. “I’ve redrawn  Mario’s frames and I swapped the palettes in the ROM,” he wrote. “I replaced the M at the top with a P for Pauline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pauline-donkey-kong.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pauline Donkey Kong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a father (of a Mario loving boy so I saved myself the trouble …), I can only think to one word for this man : Respect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sublime 3 build system for Django</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a longtime user of Sublime Text. If you’ve never tried it I really advise you to give it a look, it’s really worth it.
The beta version of Sublime 3 has been out for a few weeks now and I’m using it in parallel with the stable version 2 to test the new features.
While those new features are interesting by themselves trying a new version is also the moment where I dig in the documentation to understand the features I have not used yet in the previous versions.
And one of those features is the build systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sublime I mostly code in Python so I’ve never been attracted to this build concept … how wrong I’ve been !
You can type a script in a file in Sublime and just by hitting Ctrl+B have your script run in a python interpreter and the result displayed inside your editor. What a time saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more going back and forth between Sublime and that pesky windows command prompt (yes, I use windows at work …) to test my code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was still a problem : I do a lot of django coding and the default python build system does know how to import my django models. After a few more digging in the docs I came up with the following solution :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;working_dir&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;c:/path/to/your/django/project&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;path&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;c:/path/to/your/python/binary;c:/path/to/site-packages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;env&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;your.settings.module&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;cmd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;python&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;manage.py&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;shell&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;$file&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;file_regex&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;^[ ]*File &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;(...*?)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;, line ([0-9]*)&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;selector&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;source.python&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;shell&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Et voilà !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The gOLEDen iWatch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m on a prediction streak ! My new one is based on the two following pieces of information that surfaced recently :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the New York Times writer Nick Bilton says Apple is developing a curved screen watch (and it’s been also “confirmed” by the WSJ)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the numerous reports of last week stating that Apple has recruited a Samsung’s OLED expert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s easy enough now to join my mental dots : the future Apple Watch will sport an OLED screen and is therefore, real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that a great case has been laid last week by an ex-Apple designer on his blog about &lt;a href=&quot;http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/&quot;&gt;the potential of such a device&lt;/a&gt;. Go read, it’s a fascinating (and lengthy !) piece describing a lot of possibilities that an iWatch may unlock. Of course, this potential won’t be fulfilled overnight and will take many years to be realized. But I think we’re very close of the release of a first version in a very Apple-like way :
- release a first very limited version
- refine
- refine more
- repeat steps 2 and 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about OLED I hear you, dear readers, say ? Well, that’s a part in the solution to the main problem that such a device would face : power consumption.
Nobody want to plug its watch in a power outlet every day. Let alone several times a day …
According to wikipedia, OLED displays consume only 40% only the power used by an equivalent LCD. It’s not enough by itself but if you combine it with the new low power bluetooth connections, specially crafted private APIs in iOS and maybe one or two new secret innovation … you’re much closer of a working first step towards this new iWatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing (ever heard that sentence somewhere ?) : yesterday Tim Cook disparaged the possible use of OLED screens by Apple at a Goldman Sachs conference. I think that his point what about the use of OLED as a replacement of LCD in its current usages at Apple. Image quality, colors saturation … etc. are much less important on a 1 or 2” screen tucked on your wrist than on a 27” iMac screen. And to put this argument in context, it’s important to remember that another of OLED strength is a very good readability in direct ligth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might be useful for a watch, don’t you think ?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Game changer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From cleantechnica.com :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;According to a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between El Paso Electric Company and First Solar, electricity will be sold from First Solar’s thin-film solar panels to El Paso Electric Company for 5.8 cents per kWh.
The highly unusual thing about this is that the average residential retail cost of electricity in the United States is
11.4 cents per kWh, which is twice as much as the price at which this power plant will be producing electricity !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is very short on details about how they can provide solar electricity at such a discount. But if this is the beginning of a trend, the world is going to change very fast …&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Doctor Who killed my Adsense</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of you, dear readers, probably don’t know that one of my side projects is a little web site called pdfy.me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name imply (at least that’s my hope), it is meant to convert a web page to a pdf file for archival / latter or offline reading.
It works through a bookmarklet, a Chrome extension or a simple api.
This project comes from a client of mine who needed to be able to convert the pages of its wordpress site to pdf. Rather than running the code from his shared hosting  I decided to turn it in a webservice and host it myself on a spare server I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the users come from the Chrome extension so I decided to add an adsense baner for them in order to recoup their bandwith costs. To help adsense target their ads, I created a special page that would open when a pdf conversion was done and would use the title of the converted page to give adsense a little context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was more to experiment with adsense targetting than for money … I only made a few bucks out of the whole experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But really, that’s not my problem with adsense. At all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is that a few weeks latter my account was suspended. And why would you ask ? Well because one of the user of my site converted to pdf a bittorent tracker page that (probably) linked to an episode of the “Doctor Who” show. Not that Google may know which url was converted, that information is never disclosed to anybody of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the simple fact to have on a page of your site the words “Doctor Who” close to “DVDRip” is enough for Google to ban you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, fellow bloggers, watch out for what you write on your site. The big Mountain View Eye That Never Sleeps is watching you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say that I’m personally done with Adsense for my more serious projects. As a publisher and as a client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well played Google.&lt;/p&gt;
