        <title>Constant freezes with macOS Sierra</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since upgrading to Sierra last week, my 5K iMac late 2015 has been quite flaky. More precisely, it has experienced regular freezes that required hard reboots of the machine. When I say regular, I mean 5 or 6 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During those freezes, the mouse and keyboard would become unresponsive and the screen saver would never kick in. At the same time, the audio would continue to play and the icons in the menu bar would still be updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trolling the internet and Apple forums for a while, I think I found the culprit: Logitech Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a small utility that let’s you fine tune your Logitech mouse and keyboard but requires a kernel extension for doing its magic. Since I disabled it my iMac has not been frozen once (fingers crossed …). I have lost the butter smooth scrolling of my mouse wheel but that’s much better than rebooting all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>App Action Extension icon in XCode 8</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Aaaarrgghhhh !!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That’s generaly what I say when XCode decides to mess with me. Today I was writing an new action extension for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://librairie.cubesoft.fr&quot;&gt;Librairie app&lt;/a&gt; (note that it’s the first one I write with XCode 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything goes fine until I decide to give an icon to this sad little white square used to launch my extension. Normaly I’d go to your target settings “General” tab and choose the asset catalog containing your icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016-09-29-app-extention-icon-xcode-8/general-tab.png&quot; alt=&quot;General tab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no, no dice …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some smart product manager at Apple decided that it would be fun to see how long it would take me to do my job if they just removed the UI that they previously designed just for this purpose. The answer to this question is precisely … quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, you have to go to the build settings of your target and find the “Asset Catalog App Icon Set Name”. There, you enter the name you have given to your app icon folder (the folder with all the different icon sizes &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; your asset catalog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2016-09-29-app-extention-icon-xcode-8/build-settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;Build settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good job Apple …&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducting Commit DB</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Commit DB is my new project, freshly released in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://commit.cubesoft.fr&quot;&gt;modern MySQL client for iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Its goal is to let developpers and DBAs develop code, query and manage their databases from their iOS devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is optimized for the iPad pro with support for multitasking and keyboard shortcuts while still being useful on the iPhone for quick queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A detailed description of the feature set is available at the above link while the app can be downloaded on the App Store:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Red flag</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Flag is a startup sending you 20 prints of your pictures a month for &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flag/flagfree-photo-prints-forever&quot;&gt;Flag’s Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Flag’s free printing and shipping are paid for with ads. We use the blank space on the back of each print, that’s been wasted for the last 100 years, to deliver extra photos, captions and targeted advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of wasted ad real estate, I’d like to remember those nice marketers that the back of my iMac is still available. Hurry up, won’t last for ever !&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thougths about iOS apps upgrade, a case study - Reeder</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussions recently about the strategies app developers may use to upgrade their apps to a new version.
The argument is along the lines of the following points :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app devs rigthfully expect to be able to charge for the work they do to upgrade their apps in the long run&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An part of the apps users understand this and are willing to pay regularly for upgraded apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An other part of the apps users feels that they have already paid for an app and that should be enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I was strongly in the camp of the users feeling that we should pay for upgrades. After all, I am a professional developer (even though I’m not an app dev … yet) so I can very easily see the point of a dev who needs to bill customers for a living :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, the case of one of my most beloved app came into light : Reeder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a longtime fan and daily user of Reeder. I had bought the iPhone version, the iPad version and then the OSX version. Enough to say that I was very pleased with all those versions and never regretted to shell out good euros for those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then came the Google Readerapocalypse …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silvio Rizzi, the Reeder developer, quickly released an update for the iPhone version allowing to sync your RSS feeds to feedbin, fever and (later I think) a few other services. But the iPad and OSX users were left in the cold, waiting for an update that would turn the stale pile of bits that those apps had become to a once again useful state.
Unfortunately, that update never came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he release Reeder 2, a new paid universal version of his iOS app.
The problem is not to upgrade to a new paid version. The problem is twofold :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app description does not make a good case of why I should upgrade. It states that Reeder 2 is a feedbin / fever / whatever … client and that you can share things with a lot of services. But that’s exactly what was the previous Reeder iPhone version. So why I’m upgrading exactly ??&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I feel kind of strong-armed here. Because the iPad version never got an update to allow to sync with anything else that Google Reader I kind of have to upgrade if I want to continue (or start again in this case) to use Reeder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the takeaway from this exactly ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a big difference between an application and a service. If I buy an application, I expect it to work for as long as the underlying OS allows it to run.
If I buy a service I expect it to function as long as I pay. The way M. Rizzi handled this upgrade makes me feel I’m paying for a service, not for an app. The fact that there’s no additional functionality described (except that the app is now running again on iPad) reinforce this feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that it was not his fault if Google Reader passed away and the iPad version broke. But then why update the iPhone version back to a functioning state before the upgrade and not the iPad one ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I bought the new version anyway but I cannot help to feel that there’s a lot of goodwill lost in a case like this. And honestly, I’m not sure I’m going to buy the new OSX version when it will come out later this year. It was the version I used the least and I bought it mainly as a sign of support for the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that in this brave new iOS app store world, an app upgrade needs to articulate clearly what the value proposition is for the customer. If you need a recurring income to support your service, ask for a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So cute</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/10/4086458/father-hacks-donkey-kong-for-daughter-swaps-mario-pauline&quot;&gt;TheVerge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“When Mike Mika saw the disappointment on his daughter’s face when she realized Pauline wasn’t a playable character in Donkey Kong, he felt a call to action.
Thankfully Mika happens to be a competent developer, and after a few late-night hours spent hacking the NES version of Nintendo’s classic, he accomplished the role reversal his daughter had wished for. Mario was now under Donkey Kong’s control, and Pauline was tasked with rescuing the plumber in distress.
Following the successful endeavor, Mika shared some details of how he swapped the characters on a YouTube page demonstrating the hack. “I’ve redrawn  Mario’s frames and I swapped the palettes in the ROM,” he wrote. “I replaced the M at the top with a P for Pauline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/pauline-donkey-kong.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pauline Donkey Kong&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a father (of a Mario loving boy so I saved myself the trouble …), I can only think to one word for this man : Respect.&lt;/p&gt;
