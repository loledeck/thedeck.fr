    <p>I start iTunes. It tells me that I need to log in to Apple Music. I do not remember ever having logged off. I enter my username and password. The dialog goes away. iTunes still does not allow me to listen to music. I close and re-open iTunes. I log off and on a few times. I finally reboot my Mac. I discover that the artist I would love to listen to that morning is not available on iTunes Music. I select another artist. I hit play. Music does not come out from the built-in speakers. I plug in my old 2002 Harman Kardon SoundSticks. I plug the USB 3 to USB dongle first.</p>

  <p>This seems too bad to be real, but I‚Äôve had days recently that feel like this. I have an old Mac and sometimes think a new one would be more reliable, until I read about problems people are having with a brand new MacBook Pro and display. At least I don‚Äôt have kernel panics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mac unit sales weren‚Äôt a record, but because of rising average sale prices (thanks, MacBook Pro!), <strong>Mac revenue set a record</strong>.</p>

<p>May be because people are buying new Macs hoping they‚Äôll be more reliable ?</p>

					<p>Benjamin Mayo, writting for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-let-developers-reply-to-reviews-in-the-app-store-soon-for-ios-and-mac-apps/">9to5mac</a>:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has announced that it will soon let developers reply to reviews on the iPhone, iPad and Mac App Stores. As part of the iOS 10.3 release notes, the company says that by the time iOS 10.3 is available to customers, developers will be able to respond to customer reviews on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a major breakthrough enhancement as developers have been asking Apple for better ways to interact with customers for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see a lot of pushback from the developers community this morning along the lines of: ‚Äúthe App Store will now be your public support channel‚Äù.</p>

<p>It might be a problem but I see at least two reasons that it may be a good thing overall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Good and empathetic support will reflect positively on your app (of course, <a href="https://marco.org/apps">if you provide no support, that might be a problem</a>). I know it seems naive but I really think it will go a long way with the core users of your apps, the ones that buy already knowing what it does and want it to work rather than bash the dev for making them pay a few bucks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want Apple to listen to us and (hopefully) implement more substantive changes to the store we really ought to have a constructive attitude to the changes they‚Äôre making right now. Sure, many implementation details will probably suck at first but we have to show Apple that they‚Äôre right to not be content of the status quo.</p>

						<a class="post-link" href="/2017/01/04/uti-of-a-pem-certificate-ios.html">Finding the UTI of a PEM certificate on iOS</a>
					</h2>
				</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>UTI stands for ‚ÄúUniform Type Identifiers‚Äù.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs like the definition of a file type tying together files extensions, mime types and higher level UTIs.
In iOS (and macOS also I guess) you have to provide UTI(s) to initialize the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIDocumentMenuViewController</code> class, also known as the ‚ÄúiOS Document Picker‚Äù. This list will tell the system which type of files your Document Picker will be allowed to open.</p>

<p>This is all good and well unless you don‚Äôt know which UTI to use for the file type your looking for.</p>

<p>I was trying to import pem certificates into one of my apps and didn‚Äôt know which UTI to use for this task. Fear not, fair developer, Apple said ! Head to our official list of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content//documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/UTIRef/Articles/System-DeclaredUniformTypeIdentifiers.html">System Declared Uniform Type Identifiers</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, no declared UTI covered my use case. Or so I thought ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Having wrestled with this issue for the better part of the day I have at last found this <em>very</em> useful site: <a href="http://uti.schwa.io">UTI type browser</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the UTI list that Apple should have provided. There are much more types available than the one listed in the official Apple documentation. Including the one I needed:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>public.x509-certificate
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>App Transport Security (ATS), introduced in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11, improves user security and privacy by requiring apps to use secure network connections over HTTPS. At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year. To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is disappointing for the developers who had put in the effort necessary to make their apps comply with ATS. However, I suspect that Apple realized that there are just <em>too many edge cases</em> to really enforce this rule as is.</p>
