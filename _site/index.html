				</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>UTI stands for “Uniform Type Identifiers”.</p>

<p>It’s like the definition of a file type tying together files extensions, mime types and higher level UTIs.
In iOS (and macOS also I guess) you have to provide UTI(s) to initialize the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UIDocumentMenuViewController</code> class, also known as the “iOS Document Picker”. This list will tell the system which type of files your Document Picker will be allowed to open.</p>

<p>This is all good and well unless you don’t know which UTI to use for the file type your looking for.</p>

<p>I was trying to import pem certificates into one of my apps and didn’t know which UTI to use for this task. Fear not, fair developer, Apple said ! Head to our official list of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content//documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/UTIRef/Articles/System-DeclaredUniformTypeIdentifiers.html">System Declared Uniform Type Identifiers</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, no declared UTI covered my use case. Or so I thought …</p>

<p>Having wrestled with this issue for the better part of the day I have at last found this <em>very</em> useful site: <a href="http://uti.schwa.io">UTI type browser</a>.</p>

<p>It’s the UTI list that Apple should have provided. There are much more types available than the one listed in the official Apple documentation. Including the one I needed:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>public.x509-certificate
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>App Transport Security (ATS), introduced in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11, improves user security and privacy by requiring apps to use secure network connections over HTTPS. At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year. To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is disappointing for the developers who had put in the effort necessary to make their apps comply with ATS. However, I suspect that Apple realized that there are just <em>too many edge cases</em> to really enforce this rule as is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was it so hard, Apple ?</p>

<p>Just acknowledging that your desktop line is still alive ? In my opinion, a lot of virtual ink would have been saved about the new MacBook Pros if they had said it earlier.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn’t mean that we (“pro” users, whatever that means) are out of the woods the just yet. It may just be an iMac speed bump in the spring for all we know. But still, it feels much better than the void we’ve been living in for a long time.</p>

<p>On a related note, I thought a bit more about the end of the Apple branded monitors: I now think that it is sign that we will never see again (in the foreseable future at least) a screenless Apple desktop. It’s one thing for Apple to send its customers to LG for a secondary display used with a laptop. It a completly different one to release a brand new machine that <em>cannot</em> be used without an add-on sold by another company.</p>

<p>The Mac Pro and the Mac Mini won’t probably ever be updated again in their current form. Brace yourself for some kind of iMac Pro.</p>

					<p>I just wanted to take advantage of one of the coolest looking feature of watchOS 3 : the auto unlocking of your mac.</p>

<p>Well, the first step is to enable <em>2 factors authentification</em> for your iCloud account. My account was already on the <em>2 steps authorization</em> scheme so that should be a piece of cake, right ?</p>

<p>Wrong, so f***ing wrong.</p>

<p>You first have to downgrade your account to go back to the classic protection by security questions. By doing so, macOS asked me to create a new user because I used my iCloud account to log into my mac and for some reason that was not possible anymore.</p>

<p>Okay … I guess ?</p>

<p>At this point I had no real choice anyway so let’s go ahead : create a new password and that’s it, you have your new user identical to the previous one (or so it seems, keep reading …).</p>

<p>Then upgrade your iCloud account to <em>2 factors auth</em> : Oh boy ! There’s nothing that makes me like doing my taxes more than a good old fashioned self imposed Apple nightmare …</p>

<p>When you activate <em>2 factors auth</em> you have to validate each device you use (iPhones, iPads, Macs) with a second factor. This second factor being (it’s the only option) a prompt that appears on one of your trusted devices. The problem being that each of my devices were then asking for a validation and that none of them was showing me the said prompt.</p>

<p>So what can you do ? After several reboots, logout / login again cycles … you give up. That’s for sure what I did. I reverted my iCloud account back to security by <em>security questions</em> (because of course the <em>2 steps verification</em> scheme is not available anymore once you have <em>upgraded</em> to <em>2 factors auth</em>).</p>

<p>And now, the kicker: remember my macOS account that <em>seemed</em> OK. Well it was not. The session password was now de-synchronized from the FileVault password that I have to provide at each reboot to decrypt my hard-drive. So each time I rebooted I had to enter the FileVault rescue key.</p>

<p>Had I not set a FileVault rescue key (which would have been stupid sure, but what if you’ve lost it ?) trying to unlock my Apple Mac with my Apple Watch through my Apple iCloud account would have nixed all my data.</p>

<p>Let that sink in.</p>

<p>So thanks Apple and next time would it be possible to … No, you know what, nevermind. It’s on me.</p>

<p>Next time I won’t even try.</p>
