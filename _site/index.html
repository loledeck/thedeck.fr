<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is expected to announce plans next week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, as the technology company looks to counter the runaway success of Amazon.com Inc‚Äôs (AMZN.O) competing Alexa service.<br />‚Ä¶<br />
Currently, Apple‚Äôs Siri works with only six types of app: ride-hailing and sharing; messaging and calling; photo search; payments; fitness; and auto infotainment systems. At the company‚Äôs annual developer conference next week, it is expected to add to those categories.</p>

  <p>iBooks is not quite as unreliable and confusing as it was when I wrote about it last year, but neither has it improved nearly as much as loyal iBooks users deserve. Moreover, what little support documentation Apple provides is sketchy and inaccurate, leaving the impression that even the support and documentation departments within Apple are ignoring iBooks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federico Viticci, commenting at <a href="http://tidbits.com/article/17053">MacStories</a> about the previous quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cohen‚Äôs library may be an edge case with over 700 titles, but the problems he mentions are basic usability issues that should get fixed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the developper of an <a href="http://librairie.cubesoft.fr">iOS app to manage your ebooks library</a>, let me tell you that 700 ebooks is <em>far</em> from an edge case. A quick query in my stats showed me that the <em>average</em> number of ebooks per active user in Librairie is 1134. This makes total sense when you think about it: people using this kind of apps are serious about managing their whole books library and are voracious readers.</p>

<p>As most Apple apps, iBooks is designed for casual users. The ones who will buy a handfull of ebooks in the iBooks Store and don‚Äôt even know what an ePub file is. If you‚Äôre an ebooks power user, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/librairie-ebook-cloud-reader-epub-mobi-azw3/id742022507?l=fr&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8">I have a solution for you</a></p>

The dialog goes away. iTunes still does not allow me to listen to music. I close and re-open iTunes. I log off and on a few times. I finally reboot my Mac. I discover that the artist I would love to listen to that morning is not available on iTunes Music. I select another artist. I hit play. Music does not come out from the built-in speakers. I plug in my old 2002 Harman Kardon SoundSticks. I plug the USB 3 to USB dongle first.</p>

  <p>This seems too bad to be real, but I‚Äôve had days recently that feel like this. I have an old Mac and sometimes think a new one would be more reliable, until I read about problems people are having with a brand new MacBook Pro and display. At least I don‚Äôt have kernel panics.</p>

					<p>Benjamin Mayo, writting for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/01/24/apple-will-let-developers-reply-to-reviews-in-the-app-store-soon-for-ios-and-mac-apps/">9to5mac</a>:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has announced that it will soon let developers reply to reviews on the iPhone, iPad and Mac App Stores. As part of the iOS 10.3 release notes, the company says that by the time iOS 10.3 is available to customers, developers will be able to respond to customer reviews on the App Store.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a major breakthrough enhancement as developers have been asking Apple for better ways to interact with customers for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see a lot of pushback from the developers community this morning along the lines of: ‚Äúthe App Store will now be your public support channel‚Äù.</p>

<p>It might be a problem but I see at least two reasons that it may be a good thing overall:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Good and empathetic support will reflect positively on your app (of course, <a href="https://marco.org/apps">if you provide no support, that might be a problem</a>). I know it seems naive but I really think it will go a long way with the core users of your apps, the ones that buy already knowing what it does and want it to work rather than bash the dev for making them pay a few bucks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want Apple to listen to us and (hopefully) implement more substantive changes to the store we really ought to have a constructive attitude to the changes they‚Äôre making right now. Sure, many implementation details will probably suck at first but we have to show Apple that they‚Äôre right to not be content of the status quo.</p>
