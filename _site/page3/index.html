					<p>From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/10/4086458/father-hacks-donkey-kong-for-daughter-swaps-mario-pauline">TheVerge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When Mike Mika saw the disappointment on his daughter’s face when she realized Pauline wasn’t a playable character in Donkey Kong, he felt a call to action.
Thankfully Mika happens to be a competent developer, and after a few late-night hours spent hacking the NES version of Nintendo’s classic, he accomplished the role reversal his daughter had wished for. Mario was now under Donkey Kong’s control, and Pauline was tasked with rescuing the plumber in distress.
Following the successful endeavor, Mika shared some details of how he swapped the characters on a YouTube page demonstrating the hack. “I’ve redrawn  Mario’s frames and I swapped the palettes in the ROM,” he wrote. “I replaced the M at the top with a P for Pauline.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a father (of a Mario loving boy so I saved myself the trouble …), I can only think to one word for this man : Respect.</p>

				</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>I’m a longtime user of Sublime Text. If you’ve never tried it I really advise you to give it a look, it’s really worth it.
The beta version of Sublime 3 has been out for a few weeks now and I’m using it in parallel with the stable version 2 to test the new features.
While those new features are interesting by themselves trying a new version is also the moment where I dig in the documentation to understand the features I have not used yet in the previous versions.
And one of those features is the build systems.</p>

<p>In Sublime I mostly code in Python so I’ve never been attracted to this build concept … how wrong I’ve been !
You can type a script in a file in Sublime and just by hitting Ctrl+B have your script run in a python interpreter and the result displayed inside your editor. What a time saver.</p>

<p>No more going back and forth between Sublime and that pesky windows command prompt (yes, I use windows at work …) to test my code.</p>

<p>But there was still a problem : I do a lot of django coding and the default python build system does know how to import my django models. After a few more digging in the docs I came up with the following solution :</p>

					</h2>
				</header>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>I’m on a prediction streak ! My new one is based on the two following pieces of information that surfaced recently :</p>

<ul>
  <li>the New York Times writer Nick Bilton says Apple is developing a curved screen watch (and it’s been also “confirmed” by the WSJ)</li>
  <li>the numerous reports of last week stating that Apple has recruited a Samsung’s OLED expert.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that’s easy enough now to join my mental dots : the future Apple Watch will sport an OLED screen and is therefore, real.</p>

<p>I think that a great case has been laid last week by an ex-Apple designer on his blog about <a href="http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/">the potential of such a device</a>. Go read, it’s a fascinating (and lengthy !) piece describing a lot of possibilities that an iWatch may unlock. Of course, this potential won’t be fulfilled overnight and will take many years to be realized. But I think we’re very close of the release of a first version in a very Apple-like way :
- release a first very limited version
- refine
- refine more
- repeat steps 2 and 3</p>

<p>And what about OLED I hear you, dear readers, say ? Well, that’s a part in the solution to the main problem that such a device would face : power consumption.
Nobody want to plug its watch in a power outlet every day. Let alone several times a day …
According to wikipedia, OLED displays consume only 40% only the power used by an equivalent LCD. It’s not enough by itself but if you combine it with the new low power bluetooth connections, specially crafted private APIs in iOS and maybe one or two new secret innovation … you’re much closer of a working first step towards this new iWatch.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing (ever heard that sentence somewhere ?) : yesterday Tim Cook disparaged the possible use of OLED screens by Apple at a Goldman Sachs conference. I think that his point what about the use of OLED as a replacement of LCD in its current usages at Apple. Image quality, colors saturation … etc. are much less important on a 1 or 2” screen tucked on your wrist than on a 27” iMac screen. And to put this argument in context, it’s important to remember that another of OLED strength is a very good readability in direct ligth.</p>

<p>Might be useful for a watch, don’t you think ?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>From cleantechnica.com :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between El Paso Electric Company and First Solar, electricity will be sold from First Solar’s thin-film solar panels to El Paso Electric Company for 5.8 cents per kWh.
The highly unusual thing about this is that the average residential retail cost of electricity in the United States is
11.4 cents per kWh, which is twice as much as the price at which this power plant will be producing electricity !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is very short on details about how they can provide solar electricity at such a discount. But if this is the beginning of a trend, the world is going to change very fast …</p>
