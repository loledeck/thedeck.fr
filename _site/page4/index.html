					<p>Brent Simmons, speaking about the <a href="http://inessential.com/2016/10/26/surface_studio_notes">Surface Studio</a>:
<br />
<br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Except — and this part shouldn’t be underestimated — many of these Mac developers are here because Macs are the computer for creative professionals and artists. That’s what attracted us to Macs in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s more than a niche. It’s our identity as Mac developers: we write apps for people who make things. But what if the Surface Studio takes over as the computer for people who make things? And what if we could bring over some of our investment (such as learning Swift) with us?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never thought to even consider that as a possible future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don’t find much more hardcore mac developper than Simmons. The fact he’s even thinking about the faintest possibility of jumping ship shows two things</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>that Microsoft has desgined a very audacious and interresting product</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that Apple has so much neglected its core audience of old that the cracks are starting to show</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<br />

<p>It’s squarely aimed at creative professionals, a demographic that has always been the bread and butter of Apple pro hardware.</p>

<p>Seems a little light specswise compared to a Mac Pro (I mean, compared to what could be a Mac Pro today if it had been updated less than three years ago).</p>

<p>I hope it will succeed to shame Apple into caring more about its pro line.</p>

<p>However, it is clearly not for me. For one, I couldn’t draw anything to save my life so I wouldn’t use it for that purpose. But it seems to be a really clever use of touch for a desktop computer.</p>

<p>The big drawback: the smudges it will create on the screen. I’m already mad at the rare finger traces on my non-touch iMac screen, it would <em>positively</em> drive me crazy !</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
					<p>I mean, literaly … Look at this screenshot:</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<img src="/assets/images/201610/itunes-screenshot-1.png" alt="lots of love..." /></p>

<p>I’m an Apple Music user. And as such, I’m interrested in saying to iTunes that I <em>“like”</em> a song to get better recommandations in the future.</p>

<p>In the latest Sierra iTunes, I got used to click on the “…” icon because the heart that was present in El Capitan had disappeard. Or had it ?</p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshot above there’s in fact still a tiny ♡ that you can click to like a song. Except that it is white on white and that you can’t see it unless you click on it by accident.</p>

<p>But what is <em>really</em> weird is that clicking this ♡ does not actually select the <em>“like”</em> option in the menu for a song. So you can at the same time <em>“like”</em> and ♡ a song and they’re not the same thing apparently.</p>

<p>Ok, who I am to say that you can only love a song in a single way ? But what this star means ?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/201610/itunes-screenshot-2.png" alt="we're all made of stars" /></p>

<p>Seriously Apple, when you are done fixing Siri, please take a look at the iTunes ratings system. It could use some love …</p>

					<p><a href="https://512pixels.net/2016/10/the-inward-looking-siri/">Stephen Hackett on 512pixels.net</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On this week’s episode of Ctrl-Walt-Delete, Walt Mossberg and Nilay Patel spoke about Siri and how Apple views the service and what it can do.</p>

  <p>You should go listen to the episode, but in it, Mossberg shares that Apple is focused on improving the parts of Siri that people use most, like making phone calls and setting timers. This comes at the expense of expanding Siri’s knowledge about other things, including common, everyday questions […]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Siri continues to get better at placing phone calls, but not at searching basic information, people will just stop trying to use it for anything but placing phone calls. Siri, its uses, and where Apple improves it will just be one infinite loop of development instead of seeing substantial expansion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure I agree with Stephen on this one. Searching for information with Siri and getting accurate and reliable results sure would be nice. But I’m afraid that a lot of people won’t even think to try until Siri is bulletproof at controling their own phone.</p>

<p>Why bother to ask complex questions to Siri if you can’t even set a reminder reliably with it ? I sure don’t. Why can I write a text with Siri on my watch but not send it ? How can an assistant be useful if you have to do half its work yourself ?</p>

<p>That’s why I think Apple is smart to first improve Siri for device manipulation before extending it to further domains.</p>

<p>Which brings us to an uncomfortable discussion about Siri extensions: <em>SiriKit</em>.</p>

<p>I think that the intent (no pun intended) behind SiriKit is good: nail a few domains to make Siri bulletproof about them before extending to other domains.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, seeing the past speed of Siri’s evolution I think it’s highly unlikely that Apple will be able to iterate fast enough on those domains to keep up with the growth of other digital assitants (Alexa, Google assistant …). And their strategy mostly precludes external developers to help with empowering Siri.</p>

<p>I’m affraid that Siri will soon be stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p>
